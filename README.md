## Time Complexity - Order of magnitude I know

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74100292/158448542-f4c5c2de-b646-41c6-8ed5-25939e2a6f84.png)



Input size | Required time complexity : assuming a time limit of [1 second]
-----------|-------------------------
n <= 10 |O(n!)
n <= 20 |O(2^n)
n <= 500 |O(n^3)
n <= 5000 |O(n^2)
n <= 10^6 |O(nlogn) or O(n)
n is large |O(1) or O(logn)


| Complexity Classes | Relation with input (n)|
|------|------|
O(1)|The running time of a constant-time algorithm does not depend on the input size.
O(logn)|A logarithmic algorithm often halves the input size at each step.[Divided by the base]
O(sqrt(n))|A square root algorithm is slower than O(logn) but faster than O(n).
O(n)|This is often the best possible time complexity, because it is usually necessary to access each input element at least once before reporting the answer.
O(nlogn)|This time complexity often indicates that the algorithm sorts the input. Another possibility is that the algorithm uses a data structure where each operation takes O(logn) time.
O(n^2)|A quadratic algorithm often contains two nested loops.
O(n^3)|A cubic algorithm often contains three nested loops.
O(2^n)|This time complexity often indicates that the algorithm iterates through all subsets of the input elements.
O(n!)|This time complexity often indicates that the algorithm iterates through all permutations of the input elements.

### STL and GCC Specific Features I know
- C++ standard library functions based on binary search and work in logarithmic time:
#### The functions assume that the array is sorted.
```txt
  • lower_bound(startpointer,endpointer,value) returns a pointer to the first array element whose value is at least x.
  • upper_bound(startpointer,endpointer,value) returns a pointer to the first array element whose value is larger than x.
  • equal_range(startpointer,endpointer,value) returns both above pointers.
```
- The g++ compiler provides the following functions for counting bits:
#### The above functions only support int numbers, there are also long long versions of the functions available with the suffix ll.
```txt
• __builtin_clz(x): the number of zeros at the beginning of the number
• __builtin_ctz(x): the number of zeros at the end of the number
• __builtin_popcount(x): the number of ones in the number
• __builtin_parity(x): the parity (even or odd) of the number of ones
```

## Interesting facts I know
- A property of logarithms is that the number of digits of an integer x in base b is [logb(x) + 1]
- A useful property of logarithms is that logk(x) equals the number of times we have to divide x by k before we reach the number 1
- The newline "\n" in c++ works faster than endl, because endl always causes a flush operation
- A time complexity is only an estimate
of efficiency, because it hides the constant factors.
- NP-hard problems are an important set of problems, for which no polynomial algorithm is known
- A useful concept when analyzing sorting algorithms is an inversion: a pair of array elements (array[a],array[b]) such that a < b and array[a] > array[b], i.e., the elements are in the wrong order. 
- Counting sort is a very efficient algorithm but it can only be used when the constant c is small enough, so that the array elements can be used as indices in the bookkeeping array.
- An important use for binary search is to find the position where the value of a function changes
-  An iterator is a variable that points to an element in a data structure.
- If the value of a key is requested but the map does not contain it, the key is automatically added to the map with a default value. 
- Heap structure is much simpler than a balanced binary tree.
-  Bit representation of 25 is 11001, which corresponds to the subset {0,3,4}
- Using the and operation, we can check if a number x is even because x & 1 = 0 if x is even, and x & 1 = 1 if x is odd. More generally, x is divisible by 2^k exactly when x & (2^k-1) = 0.
- Note that x << k corresponds to multiplying x by 2^k, and x >> k corresponds to dividing x by 2^k rounded down to an integer.
- A number of the form 1 << k has a one bit in position k and all other bits are zero, so we can use such numbers to access single bits of numbers. In particular, the kth bit of a number is one exactly when x & (1 << k) is not zero.
-  The formula x | (1 << k) sets the kth bit of x to one, the formula x & ~(1 << k) sets the kth bit of x to zero, and the formula x ^ (1 << k) inverts the kth bit of x.
- The formula x & (x-1) sets the last one bit of x to zero, and the formula x &-x sets all the one bits to zero, except for the last one bit. The formula x | (x-1) inverts all the bits after the last one bit.
- A positive number x is a power of two exactly when x & (x-1) = 0.
- It is difficult to find out if the nodes in a graph can be colored using k colors so that no adjacent nodes have the same color. Even when k = 3, no efficient algorithm is known but the problem is NP-hard
